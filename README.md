Spring Cloud Config Server Repository

This repository contains properties that are loaded by the config server.

There are three approached to externalize configuration
<ul>
<li>Application Level: using configuration file. Ex: application.properties </li>

<li>Infrastructure Level: using spring profile. Ex: application-{profile}.properties</li>

<li>Centralized Configuration: Which used in the microservice architecture for large scale applications.</li>

</ul>
